    "> A **causal graphical model** is a way to represent how causality works in terms of what causes what. \n",
    "\n",
    "....\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **mediator** is a variable between the treatment and the outcome. It, well, mediates the causal effect.\n",

    "## Chapter 6\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **effect modification** or **heterogeneous treatment effect** (HTE) happens when treatment doesn't work the same for everyone. The most common way to find HTE in a regression model is by using Interaction Terms.\n",

    "> **Machine learning** is a way to make fast, automatic and good predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prediction** is understood as mapping from a known defined input to an initially unknown, but equally well defined and observable output.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Cross validation** is a statistical technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by partitioning the data into multiple subsets. The most basic cross validation divides the dataset into training set and test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **training set** is the portion of the data used to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **test set** is a portion of the data that is hidden from the model during the training phase and it is used to validate the model results.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **prediction** is a number that estimates or predicts something. It's the estimation of $\\hat{E}[y_i|X_i]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **policy** is an automatic decision rule. While a prediction is a number, a policy is a decision. \\\n",
    "For example, we can have a policy that engages with customers with income greater than 1000 and doesn't engage otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Target encoding** is a technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical features by replacing each category with the expected value of the target variable for that specific category.\\\n",
    "It is a powerful way to handle categorical variables by leveraging the relationship between the category and the target variable you are trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Feature engineering** is the process of transforming features to facilitate learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The $R^2$ metric is used to evaluate models that predict a continuous variable. It can go from minus infinity (it will be negative if the prediction is worse than the average) to $1.0$. It tells us how much of the variance in $Y$$ is explained by our model."
